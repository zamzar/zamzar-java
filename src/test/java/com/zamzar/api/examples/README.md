# Zamzar Java - Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use the Zamzar Java client library.

Note that these examples do not use exception handling for brevity. In production code, exceptions thrown by the Zamzar
Java client library should be caught and handled appropriately. Specifically, you should catch and handle
`com.zamzar.api.invoker.ApiException` in a manner that is appropriate for your application.
